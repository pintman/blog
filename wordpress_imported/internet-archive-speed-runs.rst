Viele tolle Videos von Computerspielen, bei denen man staunen mag, wie
schnell manche durch die Level rasen und wie viel einem
normalsterblichen Spieler doch so entgeht.

Speed running, trying to complete a videogame in the fastest time
possible, is almost as old as gaming itself. At least, it's almost as
old as games that have a definite end point or staging points, since
speedrunning a game with infinitely repeating levels is Sisyphean.

This collection hosts downloadable movie files documenting the swiftest
possible way to complete videogames, such Quake, Metroid, Zelda and many
others, from Speed Demos Archive, Nesvideos and other sources.

Unless specifically noted as an 'emulated' run, all speed runs are done
on the original game hardware, using only the normal save points
available to a player.
